    "# Project - Building a Calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you'll create a simple calculator which can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication or division depending upon the user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Perform operations on various data types \n",
    "* Use loops to perform iteration \n",
    "* Use conditionals to make programming decisions\n",
    "* Define and use functions \n",
    "* Ingest and parse user input \n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach \n",
    "\n",
    "* User choose the desired operation. Options 1, 2, 3, 4 are valid options for operations.  \n",
    "* Two numbers are taken and an `if…elif…else` branching is used to execute a particular section.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using functions `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()` and `divide()` evaluate respective operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The code should handle exceptions and must return **\"invalid input*** when an unexpected character is given in the input (anything other than 1 - 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Interface\n",
    "Here is the interface you are expected to build. Don't worry if it is not 100% exactly as what is shown. Focus more on the getting the logic correct at this stage. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Please select an operation:\n",
    "1. Add\n",
    "2. Subtract\n",
    "3. Multiply\n",
    "4. Divide\n",
    "\n",
    "Select operations form 1, 2, 3, 4 : 1\n",
    "Enter first number : 20\n",
    "Enter second number : 13\n",
    "20 + 13 = 33\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Arithmetic Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create four functions, one for each arithmetic operation which will perform the required operation and return the resulting value as shown below:"
